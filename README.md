## Key Components

### App.jsx
The main application component that manages global state, localStorage integration, and renders the core layout.

### AddTodo.jsx
A controlled form component for adding new tasks with input validation and submission handling.

### TodoItem.jsx
Displays individual tasks with completion toggle, deletion functionality, and creation timestamp.

### FilterBar.jsx
Provides filtering controls to switch between different task views (All, Active, Completed).

## Data Management

The application uses browser localStorage to persist task data across sessions. Each task contains:

- `id`: Unique timestamp-based identifier
- `text`: Task description
- `completed`: Boolean completion status
- `createdAt`: ISO timestamp of task creation

## Browser Compatibility

This application is compatible with all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- localStorage API

## Performance Considerations

- Components use React hooks for optimal re-rendering
- localStorage operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks for error handling
- CSS transitions provide smooth user interactions
- Vite ensures fast development builds and optimized production bundles
